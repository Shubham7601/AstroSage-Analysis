# AstroSage-Analysis
AstroSage Analysis in Excel involves leveraging various data analysis techniques to extract key insights, primarily aimed at improving operational efficiency, user satisfaction, and resource management. By importing and organizing AstroSage data, we can create visualizations, pivot tables, and statistical summaries to identify trends and patterns. This may include tracking peak call or query times, assessing user satisfaction rates, and monitoring response times. Key insights gained from this analysis could highlight the busiest periods, common user queries, average handling times, and user satisfaction trends, which can then be used to optimize staffing schedules, enhance customer support response, and improve overall service quality.


Data Cleaning: Processed raw astrological data to remove inconsistencies and prepare it for analysis.
Visualization: Created charts and graphs to visually represent correlations and trends between planetary configurations and individual life events.
Pivot Tables & VLOOKUP: Used pivot tables for data summarization and VLOOKUP for matching data across sheets for complex queries.
Report Generation: Generated detailed reports highlighting key findings for easier interpretation of astrological data.
